# Levels
The `town_update_population_levels` function at `0x0051C650` determines how many citizens are promoted and demoted and how many poor citizens emigrate.

This only ever **redistributes**. The three working classes gain and lose people only through
the discrete transfers described in
[Population](../population.md#population-is-four-times-the-number-of-jobs), four at a time per
job, so promotion and demotion move citizens between rich, wealthy and poor without changing
their total - the poor pool being the reservoir the other two draw from.

The following pseudocode denotes the calculation:
```python

    citizens: list[int]
    satisfactions: list[int]
    has_mint: bool
    dwellings_capacity: list[int]

For a fixed number of total inhabitants and satisfactions, the groups converge:
