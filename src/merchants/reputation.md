# Reputation
The function `update_merchant_reputation_and_value` at `0x004F7BB0` calculates the company value and reputation of a given merchant.

Reputation is calculated as follows:
```
reputation = min(0,
    outrigger_rep
    + tenants_rep
    + employment_rep
    + capacity_rep
    + company_value_rep
    + spouse_rep # only in hometown
    + local_social_rep
    + local_trading_rep
    + local_buildings_rep
)
```

## Outrigger
If the merchant is providing the town's outrigger, `outrigger_rep` is set to `1`.

## Tenants
The reputation achieved through tenants is calculated as follows:
```python
def get_tenant_reputation(population_type):
    rent_factor = rent_reputation_factors[rents[population_type]]
    return tenants[population_type] * rent_factor * 0.003

tenants_rep = get_tenant_reputation(rich)
    + get_tenant_reputation(wealthy)
    + get_tenant_reputation(poor)
```

The `rent_reputation_factors` table is at `0x00672DF0`:

|Rent|Reputation Factor|
